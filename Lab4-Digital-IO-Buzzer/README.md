# Lab 4: LED Level Control with Buzzer Feedback

## Task Description
Implement an LED level control system where:
- Two buttons control the number of active LEDs (increase/decrease)
- Buzzer provides audio warning for invalid operations:
  - Trying to increase beyond maximum LEDs
  - Trying to decrease below minimum LEDs
- Uses interrupts for button handling
- Visual feedback through LED bar

## Components Used
- Arduino Nano
- LEDs ×3
- Push buttons ×2
- Active buzzer ×1
- 220Ω resistors ×3 (for LEDs)
- 10kΩ resistors ×2 (for buttons)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
