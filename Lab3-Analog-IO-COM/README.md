# Lab 3 - Analog IO & Serial Communication

## Task Description
Implement a system where:
- Potentiometer position sets LED operation mode:
  - Left: Continuous ON
  - Middle: Slow blinking (1000ms)
  - Right: Fast blinking (50ms)
- Serial commands 'T'/'F' enable/disable voltage alert mode
- Mode changes reported via Serial Monitor

## Components Used
- Arduino Nano
- Potentiometer ×1
- LED ×1
- 220Ω resistor ×1
- Breadboard and jumper wires
