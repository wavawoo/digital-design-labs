# Lab 1: Digital I/O Dimmer

## Task Description
Create a dimmer that cycles through 5 brightness levels (including off) with each button press:
- Level 0: LED off
- Level 1-4: Increasing brightness (50 to 255)
- Software debouncing implementation
- Use of `INPUT_PULLUP` for simplified wiring

## Components Used
- Arduino Nano
- LED ×1
- Push button ×1
- 220Ω resistor ×1 (for LED)
- 10kΩ resistor ×1 (for button pull-down)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
