# Lab 2: LED Garland with Time Management

## Task Description
Create a 6-LED garland with smooth wave propagation effects implemented using:
1. **Blocking delays** with `delay()`
2. **Non-blocking timing** with `millis()`
3. **Hardware interrupts** with Timer1

## Components Used
- Arduino Nano
- LEDs ×6 (alternating colors)
- 220Ω resistors ×6
- Breadboard and jumper wires
